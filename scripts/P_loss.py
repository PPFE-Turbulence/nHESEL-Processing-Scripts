    """
    Calculates the z- and t-averaged P_loss over the LCFS, in units of watt.

    The tindexRange indices which t-indices to utilize during calculations. Default if from 600 to -1.

    The possible modes are: LCFS, maxMeans, max (no case sensitivity)
     - LCFS: Take the approximate value of the energy fluxes at the LCFS (slow as hell if dumpProcessing has yet to extract values from this)
     - maxMeans [DEFAULT]: Take the mean value of q_perp in a range around the max value. See maxMeans function for further details.
     - max: Take the max value of q_perp within the interval

    Modes can also be given as '0', '1', and '2' corresponding to LCFS, maxMeans, and max, in order.

    extendedOutput set to True will result in outputting not only the P_loss value, but also the P_loss values for the ions and electrons, as well as the ballooning area. The output will basically change from simply P_loss to [P_loss, P_loss_e, P_loss_i, A_b].

    As the actual LCFS position does not fit exactly with the grid, a weighted average of the two closest grid points are used,
    where the weights are based upon the absolute inverse of the distance between the gridpoints and the actual LCFS position in the simulation.

    The formula used is P_loss = (q_perpe + q_perpi)*A_b, where q_perpe and q_perpi is the average outward energy-flux
    across the LCFS in [J/m^2*s], and A_b is the total ballooning area in [m^2], given as A_b = 2*pi*(Rmajor+Rminor)*2*pi*Rminor/6.
    Here Rmajor is the major radius of the tokamak, and Rminor the minor radius.

    seriesMode allows one to ge tthe calculated P_loss for each timestep, meaning only using a z-average instead of tz-average
