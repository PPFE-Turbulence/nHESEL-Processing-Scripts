def create_data_folder(inputName, overwrite = False):
    """
    Creates a data folder with BOUT-inp within the data directory defined in the paths.py file, using a .inp filename as input.
    The filename will be used as the name for the folder, and the file itself will be copied into the folder as BOUT.inp, ready to run a nHESEL simulation.


    Parameters
    ----------
    inputName : str
        Name of the BOUT input file found in the input folder
    overwrite : Bool. Optional.
        Bool indicating whether the data folder should be overwritten, if it exists. The default is False.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        In case the folder already exists, and overwrite is set to false, an exception is raised.

    Returns
    -------
    None.
